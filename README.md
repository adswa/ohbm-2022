## Sources for OHBM 2022 resources

- The root of this repository contains the SVG sources and rendered PDF of the
  virtual poster #2057 " FAIRly big: A framework for reproducible processing of
  large-scale data - a UK Biobank showcase". ``pics`` contains the sources for
  illustrations, logos, and figures used in this poster.

- The directory ``video`` contains the sources for the video presentation
  accompanying the virtual poster. A rendered version can be found on
  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZacWgGRZY). The sources include a
  kdenlive project file (``kdenlive.kdenlive``), a number of illustrations, two
  audio tracks (music and storyline), and an xml-based kdenlive script.
  Unfortunately, the kdenlive project is not fully portable, and you will need
  to replace absolute paths in project files and scripts with paths applicable
  to your own system.

- The directory ``merch`` contains sources for DataLad-related merch, such as
  SVGs for laser engraving wooden pens.
